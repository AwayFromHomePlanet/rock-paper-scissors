From the Odin Project's JavaScript tutorial on DOM manipulation.

New things I learned/tried:
- CSS grid
- making the game look 'nice' and user-friendly I guess
- using setTimeout()
- generating random integers
- how to break a complicated process into smaller functions and figuring out how the functions would interact with each other
- the 'this' keyword
- using arrays in this way (to avoid switch statements)
- using forEach()
- learning which variables to make global and which to only use within a function
- DOM manipulation:
    - selecting elements with querySelector, querySelectorAll, and getElementById
    - adding and removing classes
    - changing textContent
